# AppleEscape
A fast-paced escape game where enemies chase you after you steal the forbidden apple. Get to the exit before they catch you!

# Internship Note
This project was developed during my internship at Rest Play, where I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in game development. Throughout the project, I focused on player mechanics, enemy AI behavior, and gameplay loop design. It was a great learning experience that helped me apply my theoretical knowledge to a real-world game prototype.
